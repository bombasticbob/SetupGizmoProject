<H1>Including Frameworks (like '.Net') in your setup</H1>
<br />
<p>
Applications that require the Microsoft '.Net' Framework, or other major 'Frameworks', may want to include the installer within the application setup process.  Although it is HIGHLY recommended that you execute the Microsoft '.Net' Framework installer as a separate &quot;pre-requisite&quot; step, you could also include it as part of your regular 'SETUP'  process.  At the time this help file was written, the '.Net' framework self-extracting SETUP utility was approximately 24Mb in size.  As such it would be most practical to invoke it from 'autorun.exe' or by using your own SETUP utility.
</p>
<p>
(Diskette setups and self-extracting setups that include the Microsoft '.Net' Framework are NOT recommended).
</p>
<p>
Additionally, a 'Framework' such as the Microsoft '.Net' Framework may include supplementary license agreements that are specifically related to the Framework.  You would either be required to specify the Framework's license as part of your application's license, or else display the license agreement for the Framework during your application's setup process.

<H3>USING  'AUTORUN.EXE' TO INSTALL THE MICROSOFT '.NET' FRAMEWORK</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Copy the file 'DOTNETFX.EXE' into a directory named '\dotNetFramework' on your installation CD (you will need a CD Install to make this work).</LI>
<LI>Determine the correct version of the '.Net' Framework for the self-extracting executable.  The easiest way to determine this would be to right-click the icon for the executable file itself, and examine the version resource.  Only the 1st 3 numbers are needed.  You can also look for an application under &quot;Administrative Tools&quot; on Windows NT/2k/XP with a link similar to &quot;Microsoft .Net Framework Configuration&quot;.  By running this application it will give you the correct version information.  The version ID will look similar to &quot;v1.1.4322&quot; for version 1.1, build 4322 (the sub-build is not used).</LI>
<LI>Manually edit the 'autorun.inf' file generated by SETUP and add the path to 'dotnetfx.exe' and the corresponding version ID to the 'autorun.inf' under the heading [.Net] (place it below the '[Autorun]' section) as follows:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[.Net]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SETUP=dotNetFramework\dotnetfx.exe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VERSION=v1.1.4322<br />
<br />
You can elect NOT to create this file after having created the first SETUP image for all subsequent images, and thereby leave it 'intact'.</LI>
<LI>Now copy all of the SETUP files to your CD as normal, including the 'dotnetfx.exe' file (placing it into the specified directory).  'autorun.exe' will detect these new entries and check the '.Net' Framework installation as a prerequisite to installing your application.</LI>
</OL>
<br />
<H3>ADDING MICROSOFT '.NET' FRAMEWORK COMPONENTS TO CAB FILES</H3>
<LI>Copy the file 'DOTNETFX.EXE' to the directory containing your application's files to be included on the SETUP disk.</LI>
<LI>Add 'DOTNETFX.EXE' to the list of files to include, and specify 'Exec After Copy' and 'Delete after Exec'.  It is not important where you install it, but it's probably best to install it to the temporary directory using '%tmpdir%'.</LI>
<LI>For the command line option, use the following string:  '/Q' (for 'quiet' mode).  There is no known option available to prevent a reboot following execution of 'dotnetfx.exe', though it is the author's experience that it has not (yet) attempted a reboot following an update or first time installation of the '.Net' framework.</LI>

<p>
Although a number of people believe that using '.Net' framework enhances their applications, it has been my personal experience that this
framework decreases the efficiency of your application on a number of levels.  Quite frankly, it is a poor design.  You are MUCH better off
statically linking foundation classes or just writing for the Win32 API, rather than using '.Net' for anything.  However, if you think you
actually need it, including it within the Setup IS supported by S.F.T. Setup Gizmo.  It's just NOT RECOMMENDED.
