<center><h1>Creating a Code Signing Cert from your own Root CA Cert</h1></center>
<p>
For the purpose of this documentation, we're interested in making certs that sign code.  And so the
next steps will generate JUST THAT, a 'Publisher' certificate that you can sign code with.  You will
be prompted for passwords at a couple of points, and for other information.  Since you can generate
as many as you like, using YOUR very own Root CA certificate, you should experiment with the data
entry and possibly automate it all.  I did.
</p>
<p>
The step-by-step example below uses the 'openssl' utility, which you can easily install
on Linux, on Windows under Cygwin, or natively on Windows using the installer from the
<a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/openssl.htm">GNU WIN32 project</a>
on SourceForge.<br />
</p>
<p>
If you have not already created a root certificate, you can find instructions on how to do that
on the <a href="create_cert_authority.html">Creating your own Root CA Certificate</a> page.

<li><b>Create another key for your code signing certificate</b><br />
    This key will be used in the code signing process, and should NOT be password
    protected.  Don't let it get out of your control.<br />
    To create a non-password-protected key into the file 'MyCodeSigningCert.key':<br />
    <pre>    openssl genrsa -out MyCodeSigningCert.key 2048</pre>
    The key size parameter is 2048, as before.  Use whatever you like.</li>
    <br />
    <br />
<li><b>Create a certificate 'request' file</b><br />
    This is an intermediate step for creating a signed certificate.  Again, you will be asked several
    questions for information to be embedded in the certificate.  The 'description' needs to be chosen
    carefully, as this will appear as the name in your certificate store (if you import it), and in
    some cases needs to 'match' something to be valid (such as an SSL certificate).<br />
    <pre>    openssl req -new -key MyCodeSigningCert.key -out MyCodeSigningCert.csr -reqexts v3_req -nodes</pre>
    This creates the REQUEST for a certificate.  Once done, you can use this multiple times to create certificates
    with newer expiration dates, as needed.  Also, the '-nodes' parameter keeps it from encrypting the key,
    so you should NOT let this thing out of your hands.  As far as I can tell, '-nodes' is necessary.</li>
    <br />
    <br />
<li><b>Create a certificate file with an expiration date and additional info</b><br />
    This step creates the actual certificate.  To do this properly, you need to create a small file that
    contains the correct options for your certificate, since the default openssl implementation does
    not seem to have this.  For this step I used a shell script (this should work under Cygwin).  YMMV<br />
    <pre>
    #!/bin/sh

    cat &gt;temp.cnf &lt;&lt;THING
    [usr_cert]
    nsCertType = objsign
    basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
    subjectKeyIdentifier=hash
    authorityKeyIdentifier=issuer
    keyUsage = nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment, keyAgreement, keyCertSign
    extendedKeyUsage = codeSigning, serverAuth, clientAuth, emailProtection, timeStamping, \
                       OCSPSigning, msCodeInd, msCodeCom, msCTLSign, msEFS

    THING

    openssl x509 -req -in MyCodeSigningCert.csr -CA MyCert.pem \
            -CAkey MyCert.key -CAcreateserial \
            -extfile temp.cnf -extensions usr_cert \
            -out MyCodeSigningCert.crt -days 365 -sha256
    </pre>
    Then, if you want to view the resulting certificate's encoded information, you can do so with this command:
    <pre>    openssl x509 -noout -text -in MyCodeSigningCert.crt</pre>
    NOTE:  The Microsoft example for making a code signing certificate (from
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/jj835832%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">HERE</a>)
    has the following additional parameter, which they say restricts the usage of the certificate:
    <pre>    /eku "1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3,1.3.6.1.4.1.311.10.3.13"</pre>
    The '/eku' parameter (2 OID values, comma and no space separates them) corresponds to the 'extendedKeyUsage' member
    of the '[usr_cert]' block that is written to the temporary configuration file.  The first 'OID' in that
    list is 'codeSigning', and the second is (apparently) a Microsoft custom OID that CertMgr.msc displays as
    &quot;Lifetime Signing&quot;.  What it REALLy does is RESTRICT the application's signature to the expiration date
    of the cert (so don't use it unless you want to do this).  The 'extendedKeyUsage' definition in the shell script
    has 'codeSigning' (the first one), plus &quot;all of the rest I could find&quot;.  The apparent reasoning is that
    whenever this certificate entry is NOT defined, the extended usage is 'un-restricted'.  So defining it restricts
    the usage (to help protect against mis-use). HOWEVER, I'm concerned that Microsoft may NOT allow signed drivers and
    signed code to load WITHOUT the presence of 'extendedKeyUsage'.  So (in sticking with the intent of their documentation)
    I have included it in the example, here.<br /><br />
    So in summary, the example from the 'openssl' command (above) basically allows ALL usages except 'Revocation List'
    related functions, AND includes an 'extended key usage' for Code Signing (but NOT &quot;Lifetime Signing&quot;) and
    everything else I could find. And if you want to manage the certificate's capabilities, you can always add or
    remove items from the 'keyUsage' or 'extendedKeyUsage' assignment, as you see fit.  For more information, see the
    <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/apps/x509v3_config.html">OpenSSL config file documentation</a></li>
    <br />
    <br />
<li><b>Create a 'pfx' certificate file that Microsoft's CertMgr can import along with a key</b><br />
    This step is very important, because without the private key, you can't use it for CODE SIGNING,
    and that was the whole POINT, right?  So, we do that here.  You'll be prompted for passwords again.
    When you password protect the file, a blank password is ok if you want.  I did that for my test.<br />
    <pre>    openssl pkcs12 -export -out MyCodeSigningCert.pfx -inkey MyCodeSigningCert.key -in MyCodeSigningCert.crt</pre>
    NOW, you have a 'pfx' file that you can import with Microsoft' Certificate Manager 'CertMgr.msc'.</li>
    <br />
    <br />
<li><b>As before, convert the certificate into a '.cer' file in X.509 DER format.</b><br />
    You can convert it easily with a command similar to the following:<br />
    <pre>    openssl x509 -in MyCodeSigningCert.crt -outform der -out MyCodeSigningCert.cer</pre>
    This file is the one you will install on end-user machines in the 'TrustedPublisher' folder when signing
    code.  Microsoft uses this store for device driver verification and (as far as I can tell) application
    verification.  As with the 'ROOT' store, you have to do this with Admin privileges so that it goes into
    the 'Local Machine' store rather than the 'user' store.  For more information, see
    <a href="certificates.html">Adding Certificates to the System Certificate Store</a> and
    <a href="CertMgr.html">Using the CertMgr Management Console</a>.
