<H1>Adding Certificates to the System Certificate Store</H1>
<br />
<p>
A new feature of the SFT Setup Gizmo is the ability to add 'root' certificates
to the system certificate store as part of your setup.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Since Windows Vista, 'certificate signing' has been required for device drivers,
particularly for the 64-bit platform.  Using an 'approved' CA for this purpose
can be expensive, sometimes costing you several hundred dollars per year.  Obviously
for open source and independent software developers, this is VERY undesireable.  It
is, in many ways, like a 'toll booth' in which a 'cottage industry' (driver signing
certificate authorities) exact a kind of 'toll' on every software developer that
needs to sign his code for some reason.  And that's hardly FAIR.
</p>
<br />
<p>
The main purpose of this certificate signing policy is for DRM; that is, signed
drivers supposedly provide a kind of 'liability' against the abuse of DRM.
Additionally, they provide a kind of 'false sense of security' for end-users who
want to install software or 3rd party drivers on their computers, making it appear
as if the driver or software is 'safe' because it was signed and/or verified.
</p>
<br />
<p>
But the fact is that ANYONE can create a certifying authority, and install this into
the root certificate store on ANY computer, using an installation program with that
capability.  And the SFT Setup Gizmo makes that process easy.
</p>
<br />
<p>
What this does for YOU, the developer, is eliminate the 'toll booth' aspect of
certificates and code signing, by allowing YOU to become &quot;your own&quot;
certificate authority (CA).  Then, you can issue certificates to yourself and
sign your code as you see fit.  The 'down side' of course is that the 'Root CA'
certificate that you create for yourself MUST be installed on the target machine
for anyone who might be needing to use it.<br />
</p>
<br />
<p>
This is where the SFT Setup Gizmo comes into play.  It can install your root CA
certificate AUTOMATICALLY during the setup process, making all of this very very
easy to implement.  You're welcome.
