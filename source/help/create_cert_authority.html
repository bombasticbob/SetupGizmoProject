<br />
<p>
The process of creating a root certificate is VERY EASY.  A general overview of the
process can be found <a href="http://mrp3.com/cert_authority.html">HERE</a> if you like.
</p>
<br />
<p>
The step-by-step example below uses the 'openssl' utility, which you can easily install
on Linux, on Windows under Cygwin, or natively on Windows using the installer from the
<a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/openssl.htm">GNU WIN32 project</a>
on SourceForge.
</p>
<br />
<p>
If you follow this procedure as stated, you'll have a self-signed root cert capable
of being installed by the S.F.T. Setup Gizmo, and useful for creating code-signing
certificates.
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Create the key for your root certificate</b><br />
    This key will be used in the signing process, and should be password
    protected.  Otherwise, it could be abused if the key ever got out of
    your hands.  Yes, this kind of thing happens.<br />
    To create a password-protected key into the file 'MyCert.key':<br />
    <pre>    openssl genrsa -des3 -out MyCert.key 2048</pre>
    The key size parameter is 2048, as in the web-page example.  You can pick a
    different value if you like.</li>
    <br />
    <br />
<li><b>Create a self-signed 'root' certificate 'pem' file</b><br />
    This will create a self-signed root certificate.  You will be asked several
    questions for information to be embedded in the certificate.  The 'CN' will
    appear as the name of the certificate, so choose wisely.<br />
    <pre>    openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key MyCert.key -sha256 -days 365 -out MyCert.pem</pre>
    The sample creates a certificate that is good for one year (365 days).  you should consider
    limiting the expiration date of your certificate, and just create a new one whenever
    it expires.  This limits the possibility of it being exploited for nefarious purposes.</li>
    <br />
    <br />
<li><b>Convert the certificate into a '.cer' file for S.F.T. Setup Gizmo</b><br />
    S.F.T. Setup Gizmo needs this file to be a '.cer' file in X.509 DER format.
    You can convert it easily with a command similar to the following:<br />
    <pre>    openssl x509 -in MyCert.pem -outform der -out MyCert.cer</pre>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
Once you have the '.cer' certificate file, you can add it to your setup via the
'Cert Files' button on the opening page for the S.F.T. Setup Gizmo.
