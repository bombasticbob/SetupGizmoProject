<H1>Overview of S.F.T. Setup Gizmo</H1>
<br />
<p>
The 'S.F.T. Setup Gizmo' is a tool for programmers to very quickly generate
a SETUP system for their applications.  Although other SETUP systems are
available, even at no cost, they take a great deal of time to learn how
to use, even for the simplest applications.
</p>
<p>
That is the reason that the 'S.F.T. Setup Gizmo' was created:  To make
SETUP the easiest thing that you do.  It is only a matter of placing all 
of the appropriate files into a single directory tree, then indicating how
each of them is to be installed, and adding the appropriate registry keys.
'S.F.T. Setup Gizmo' then creates a set of install diskettes, and a
'SETUP.INF' information file, and places the programs 'SETUP.EXE' and
'UNINST.EXE' onto disk #1 (or the DISK1 directory of a multi-disk CD
image).  Optionally, you can include a license agreement as a standard text
(.txt) or RTF (.rtf) file, which is then copied onto DISK #1 along with
'SETUP.INF' and displayed when the user runs SETUP (the user will have to
agree to the license to proceed).
</p>
<p>
<!--The first disk in the disk image (or the compressed files directory on CD ROM)-->
The compressed files directory on a CD ROM image will contain the SETUP.EXE, UNINST.EXE,
SETUP.INF, and optional LICENSE.TXT files, in addition to the first cabinet
(compressed) file.  Cabinet files can be uncompressed using the 'expand' utility
as found on every Windows setup CD since '95.
<!--  As a courtesy, this utility is also included with the 'S.F.T. Setup Gizmo'.-->
The main reason that 'UNINST.EXE' has been left uncompressed is to make it very
easy for a user to uninstall an application by inserting the 1st install CD
without having to re-install the product FIRST just to get the UNINSTALL program.
Many people inadvertently delete things, and may need to uninstall the software to
repair their system.  Since the 'INF' file contains an 'UNINSTALL' section, the
'UNINST.EXE' program will simply read the 'INF' file, delete the appropriate files,
remove the appropriate sub-directories, and clean up the registry entries that you
entered.  As such, it is important to include ALL registry entries in the INF file.
</p>
<br />
<H3>LICENSE</H3>
<p>
Licensed users of the 'S.F.T. Setup Gizmo' have an unlimited royalty-free
distribution license for the re-distribution of 'SETUP.EXE' and 'UNINST.EXE'
as part of a product installation generated by the S.F.T. Setup Gizmo, and
exclusive rights to any other output that the S.F.T. Setup Gizmo application
generates, including '.giz' files (setup information) and various other
information files (such as '.INF' files for your setup).
<!--The use of the Microsoft components
from the 'Cabinet SDK' (specifically, the 'MAKECAB' utility) are covered by
the license for the S.F.T. Setup Gizmo so long as these components are not
re-distributed in whole or in part.  If you want to re-distribute these
components, you must obtain an appropriate license from Microsoft (such as
an MSDN subscription).  NOTE, on versions of windows starting with XP,
distributing the 'MAKECAB' utility is not needed (it is part of the
operating system), and it will not be installed.-->
<br /><br />
The S.F.T. Setup Gizmo itself is an open source application, and S.F.T. Inc.
shall not be held liable for any modifications and/or re-distributions that
were derived from the original source.  Derived works must include an appropriate
license (and disclaimer) that excludes S.F.T. Inc. from any liabilities whatsoever.
<br /><br />
The associated components may only be installed on a single machine for each
license purchased, or on a network server so long as it is only used by a
single individual for each license purchased.  No modifications to any of
the included software or binary output files may be performed by any user,
whether licensed or not, with the singular exception of adding a 'signature'
using an appropriate 'signing' utility, such as &quot;Authenticode&quot;.  This is to
protect S.F.T., Inc. from any damages that might occur due to such modified
code or data.  Modifications to other output files, such as '.GIZ' files or
'.INF' files, may be performed as needed.
</p>
<p>
Unlicensed users may use the 'S.F.T. Setup Gizmo' for an unlimited evaluation
period, and may not distribute any of the components separately (other than as part
of a SETUP created by the 'S.F.T. Setup Gizmo'), or use the output from the
S.F.T. Setup Gizmo to generate any kind of setup image(s) for commercial
distribution.<br />
<b>'Commercial Distribution'</b> is defined as a) 'for profit' (you sell the
application), or b) 'for promotion' (you use the output to promote something,
such as a commercial web site, product, or business activity).
</p>
<p>
Basically, this means that under most circumstances you can use the S.F.T. Setup Gizmo and its components for evaluation or non-profit purposes only unless you purchase an appropriate number of licenses, and if you commercially distribute products using images created with 'S.F.T. Setup Gizmo', you've just violated the copyright and license agreement.
</p>
<p>
If for some reason you need to change the license information (user name or company name) you may contact S.F.T. Inc. and request a new license at no additional charge to you.
</p>
<p>
To re-register your product, you can select the 'Re-Register S.F.T. Setup Gizmo' option from the 'system menu' in the S.F.T. Setup Gizmo application 'SetupGiz.exe', or run 'SetupGiz.exe' with a command line containing '/REGISTER'.  This will re-prompt you to enter your registration information.
</p>
<p>
You should ALWAYS keep a record of your registration information and the authorization code.  You will not be able to re-register the product without it.
