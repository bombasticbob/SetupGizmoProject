<p>
You will first need to import the 'pfx' certificate file (a package containing the
cert as well as the private key) into a certificate store using CertMgr.  For this
example, we will be using the 'User' certificate store, and will import this certificate
into the 'PrivateCertStore' folder.  For more information, see relative help and documentation
for 'CertMgr.msc', the management console for certificate stores.
</p>
<p>
To sign your code with a signing certificate, you can use the 'SignTool' application
with a command line similar to the following:<br />
<pre>
    SignTool sign /s "PrivateCertStore" /n "MyCodeSigningCert" /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll MyCode.exe
</pre>
where the certificate name (rather than 'MyCodeSigningCert') will be the one you assigned when you created the certificate
request (csr) file, 'PrivateCertStore' is the certificate store you imported it into, and 'MyCode.exe' is the executable file
(or other object) you are signing.  The certificate name will show up in the 'CertMgr.msc' display after you have added the
cert, as a double-check.
